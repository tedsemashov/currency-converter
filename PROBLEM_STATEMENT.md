# Create an application by using data from a public API

## Basics

- You are provided with a boilerplate React project (Create React App). Feel free to extend, customise or start from scratch as you see fit.
- Feel free to use the offline git repo that is created to work offline with your tools of choice. Be sure to upload everything to the server before the deadline.
- Try to keep quality of this project as if it is meant to be deployed to production.

## Product requirements

- Implement a table of the latest currency rates.
- Data is to be retrieved from the following open source API: https://www.vatcomply.com/documentation#rates.
- Initially there must be a button. Data is fetched and displayed after the button is clicked.
- "Loading" message/UI component must be shown while data is fetched.
- Error modal must be shown when data fetch fails.
- **Provide at least basic styling.**

## Implementation requirements

- React framework must be used.
- A scalable application state management framework of your choice must be used.
- Application parts must be tested.
  - You don't have to write tests for every part, write a single one for every type of test (for example: action creator, reducer, asynchronous function, UI component, UI component with user interactions are different types of tests)
- **Please construct the code in a manner that is scalable.**
- **You can use whatever libraries you want.**
- TypeScript is preferred over JavaScript.
